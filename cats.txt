Using React/Redux:

1) Get cat images from "http://mapd-cats.azurewebsites.net/catpics"
2) Get cat facts from "http://mapd-cats.azurewebsites.net/catfacts"
3) Append the results to DOM.
  - One image should have one fact associated with it.
4) Be able to remove/delete images (with attached fact) from DOM.

When completed, please let us know and state how long the project took to complete.


Webpack/babel/sass config took me about 1.5hrs (something that worked in a previous project didn't work for this :thinking_face:).
Understanding how async works with redux/thunk took about 4hrs (the async example code led me slightly astray).
Basic coding of data flow structure (to include a slight refactor after realizing) redux requires immutable objects took about 3hrs.
Adding styles, animations, and logic around errors and empty lists took about 2-3hrs.

*All in all I spent ~11 hours on this task across 4 or 5days.*
